#' rscorecard: A method to download College Scorecard data.
#'
#' The rscorecard package provides a series of piped functions (a la
#' \code{\link[dplyr]{dpylr}}) to facilitate downloading Department of
#' Education College Scorecard data.  In reality it is simply a method
#' for converting idiomatic R code into a properly formatted URL
#' string that is then queried. This package requires an API key,
#' which can be requested at
#' \url{https://api.data.gov/signup/}.
